...I need financial assistance in order to enrol in Jet brains classes. Due to my limited finances. My parents gave me a great deal of support, but since our family's income was low, I only received a little amount of financial assistance. In order to reduce the financial burden on my family, I took out student loans to pay for my tuition. For the time being, I work 19 hours a week on campus to support myself. However, this year's increased tuition rates have exacerbated my financial struggles. As a biotechnologist, I want to commit more time to these courses since they are fundamental to my degree and my future career. Having financial troubles might make it easier for me to do the coursework. I would much appreciate assistance so that I may successfully finish this course. 
The completion of these courses will be considerably aided by the given scholarship. This stipend enabled me to work less and devote more time to my schooling. As I explore my ability to satisfy people's needs, I will be able to do more community service thanks to this award. In addition, receiving this grant will boost my likelihood of attending the conference and being acquainted with cutting-edge technology. This scholarship will motivate me to push even harder to attain academic excellence. 
... 
... You have my gratitude for doing this for me.

... With a strong foundation in "science, computers, and problem-solving skills," I am excited to begin learning "Python," as I see it as the first step toward creating good projects that contribute to the advancement of new scientific discoveries, thereby making life easier for everyone and bringing us closer to resolving the world's most pressing issues. Learning new things and developing my skillset are two of my primary professional aspirations. Since "programming" is a field in which one is expected to constantly learn and improve, I believe that enrolling in a course will help me make significant progress in this area.
... 
... I'm hoping to further my career in "Python Core and Bioinformatics" by enrolling in relevant courses and maintaining my membership in a wide range of professional organizations. I've also observed that many companies are offering internships and entry-level positions in the field. Since the candidate's knowledge requirements are high for the many available positions in this industry, I foresee using the skills I acquire in this course to get a job at one of the world's top creative agencies or corporations.
